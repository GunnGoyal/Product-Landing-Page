                <h2>CAN I RECYCLE MY NIKE SHOES?</h2>
                <p>
                    es, when your shoes can't handle another mile, trip up the court, or cut across the field, we want them back.

We recycle and donate used athletic shoes and clothing. It's part of our Move to Zero journey toward zero carbon and zero waste. You drop off used athletic gear at a participating Nike retail store, and we sort it to determine what can be recycled and what can be cleaned and then donated. Either way, together we can help divert materials from landfills.
